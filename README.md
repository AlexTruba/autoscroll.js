##How To use verticalScroller.js

It is very easy to install, just copy and paste the verticalScroller.js in your js root folder and then initialize its path
in your html file. It's better to initialize it in head tag.
```
<head>
 <script src="path/to/verticalScroller.js"></script>
</head>
```
##### Dependency : It depends on jquery. So initialize jquery before verticalScroller.js

#General Notes
